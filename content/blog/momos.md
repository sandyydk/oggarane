**Cooking Procedure**:  
1. Mix flour, salt and oil  in a bowl and add water to make a smooth dough. Just like poori dough. Keep aside covered.
Heat a pan with oil, add chopped garlic, ginger,saute it well. Add all finely chopped veggies and fry in high flame for a minute. Add salt, pepper, soya sauce, oregano powder and mix well. Continue to stir fry on high heat.  
2. Check the taste and add salt, pepper or soy sauce, if required. Let the stuffing cool completely.  
Divide the dough into equal portions.Roll in dry flour and roll into small puris keeping the edges thin and the centre thick.    
3. Place a portion of stuffing in the centre, fold one end over the other and give it a half moon shape. For another gather the edges and seal together.Join all the pleats in the center.Prepare all momos this way and keep them covered under a moist napkin,till you are ready to steam them.      
4. Use idli pans or pressure cooker to steam. Steam the veg momos for 10 minutes till the outer cover becomes transparent. (when you touch the momos then dough should not feel sticky to you. this means they are done and the momos will have a transparent look.)      
5. Serve Veg Momos with red chilly Chutney/sauce and Enjoy.
