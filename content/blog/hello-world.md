***ABOUT ME***

I am Bhashya Laxmi, born and bought up in a small village near the coastal city of Mangalore and married to Sandeep Bhat Yethadka. Currently working in Atkins Pvt Ltd India as an Environmental Engineer at Bangalore.
My culinary skills and healthy recipes which I post in Oggarane are what I learnt from my Amma and sister. My special thanks to my parents who made me to learn cooking at a very young age by assisting my Amma in cooking which made me feel confident in improving my cooking skills. Also want to thank my in-laws for their support and encouragement. A very special thanks to my better half for continuous help and support in the making of this blog.

**"*OGGARANE*"**

The word Oggarane originated from the Kannada language. It's a cooking technique used in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan in which whole spices are roasted briefly in oil or ghee or butter to liberate essential oils from cells and thus enhance their flavours, before being poured, together with the oil, into a dish. Oggarane is also practiced by dry roasting whole spices in a pan before grinding the spices. Oggarane is typically done at the beginning of cooking, before adding other ingredients in the making of a dish or it may be added to a dish towards the end. So a dish is never complete without "*OGGARANE"*.
Oggarane would include vegetarian recipes on bakes, desserts, salads, juice, continental, Indo-Chinese food, soups, traditional foods, Sathvik foods and many more for aficionados of food.
