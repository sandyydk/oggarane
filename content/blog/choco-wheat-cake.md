**Baking procedure**:
1. In a bowl add 1.25 cups of sieved powdered sugar, 1/2 cup of curd/buttermilk and 3/4 cup of oil/ghee and mix well until it becomes creamy.
2. Add 2 cups of sieved Wheat flour, 1/2 spoon Baking powder,1/4 spoon salt, 1/4 spoon Baking soda, 1/2 cup of choco powder and mix all ingredients well until it becomes thick creamy batter. Add water as required till batter becomes thick and creamy.
3. Now pour the batter into standard cake tray greased with oil or ghee, sprinkled with wheat flour and keep it aside. We can bake it in two ways.

**Cooker**: Here I have used an aluminium cooker for baking. Fill 1/4th of the cooker with table salt and pre-heat it for a while. Place a steel stand to hold the cake tray inside the cooker. Now place the cake tray inside the cooker and bake  it for 35 min. After 20 min just check whether it's baked completely or not by pricking the cake with a wooden stick or steel knife. If the cake is baked completely it wont stick to the wooden or steel stick.

**Oven**: If you are using the oven, preheat the oven for 10 min and place the cake tray inside the oven and bake it for 40 min in the microwave.
